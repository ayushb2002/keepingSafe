We at present are living in such a horrible condition that no one, even in their worst nightmare thought, that they would get locked in their own houses getting drooped and devoid of any human connection. If we contemplate about it on a deeper level, it's as if nature is telling us that how even the smallest of things can make an impact on the whole world, considering that it just started with an anonymous man just slurping some bat soup and ended up making the whole world a human zoo.
Now our team has taken a positive inspiration from this scenario and decided to bestow our technical skills and best efforts in the hopes of ending this misery as soon as possible. Our mission is to make people aware and alert about their surroundings in terms of this Pandemic so that they can be safe and break this chain reaction of spread of this contagious virus, to make hospitals and any kind of remedies which could help prevent or cure the symptoms of the virus, available to as many people as possible. Our team just demands your support in helping to spread this awareness and nothing else.
Together we can and we will, survive and thrive.
